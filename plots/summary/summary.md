### Analysis of Outputs and Relation to the Topic

#### 1. Monthly Distribution of Flash Flood Observations


- **Observation:**
  - Flash flood observations are highest in July and August, indicating a seasonal pattern, likely due to heavy summer rainfall or monsoon activity.
  - There is a noticeable increase in observations in October, suggesting a secondary peak, possibly related to fall weather patterns or tropical storm remnants.

- **Relation to the Topic:**
  - **Bias Detection:** The data is heavily skewed towards certain months, which could introduce seasonal bias. This needs to be accounted for in predictive models to avoid overfitting to these months.
  - **Data Gaps:** There are fewer observations in other months, which may represent gaps in data collection or lower flash flood occurrences.

#### 2. Yearly Distribution of Flash Flood Observations

- **Observation:**
  - The number of observations varies significantly by year, with a noticeable drop in 2020. This might be due to reduced data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  - There is an increasing trend in observations from 2019 to 2022.

- **Relation to the Topic:**
  - **Bias Detection:** The drop in 2020 and varying annual counts could introduce temporal bias. It's important to ensure the model can generalize across different years.
  - **Data Gaps:** The low number of observations in 2020 indicates a significant gap, which could affect the reliability of long-term trend analysis.

#### Analysis of Monthly Distribution of Flash Flood Observations

##### Monthly Distribution for 2020


- **Observation:**
  - Flash flood observations are highest in March, April, July, and August.
  - There's a significant peak in August with slightly lower but still high observations in March, April, and July.

- **Relation to the Topic:**
  - **Bias Detection:** The distribution shows a concentration of observations during the summer months, particularly in July and August. This could introduce a seasonal bias if not accounted for in predictive models.
  - **Data Gaps:** Fewer observations are seen in other months, which could indicate either lower occurrences of flash floods or gaps in data collection.

##### Monthly Distribution for 2021


- **Observation:**
  - Flash flood observations peak significantly in July, followed by a lower but still substantial number in August.
  - There are minor observations in January, June, September, October, and December.

- **Relation to the Topic:**
  - **Bias Detection:** The data is highly skewed towards July and August, indicating a potential seasonal bias. This pattern needs to be addressed in the model to avoid overfitting.
  - **Data Gaps:** The low number of observations in other months, especially at the start and end of the year, suggests potential gaps in data collection or lower occurrence rates.

##### Monthly Distribution for 2022


- **Observation:**
  - Flash flood observations are highest in July and August, with a noticeable peak in August.
  - There are some observations in June but none in other months.

- **Relation to the Topic:**
  - **Bias Detection:** The distribution shows a concentration of observations in the summer months (June, July, August), with the highest peak in August. This indicates a strong seasonal bias.
  - **Data Gaps:** The absence of observations in other months highlights significant gaps in the data, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive data collection strategy across the entire year.

##### Summary of Monthly Distribution Analysis

1. **Seasonal Patterns:**
   - All three years (2020, 2021, and 2022) show a strong seasonal pattern with peaks in July and August. This is likely due to heavy summer rainfall or monsoon activity.

2. **Bias Detection:**
   - The data is heavily skewed towards the summer months, particularly July and August, across all three years. This seasonal bias needs to be accounted for in predictive models to avoid overfitting.

3. **Data Gaps:**
   - There are fewer observations in the other months, which could indicate gaps in data collection or lower occurrences of flash floods. It's essential to ensure comprehensive data collection throughout the year to improve model reliability.


#### 3. Spatial Distribution of Flash Flood Observations
- **Observation:**
  - The observations are concentrated in specific geographical areas, with clusters in the southwestern United States.
  - Sparse observations in some regions indicate underrepresentation.

- **Relation to the Topic:**
  - **Bias Detection:** Geographic clustering suggests spatial bias, where certain regions are overrepresented while others are underrepresented. This affects the model's ability to generalize spatially.
  - **Data Gaps:** Identifying underrepresented areas can help prioritize future data collection efforts to fill these gaps.
