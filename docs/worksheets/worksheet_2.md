## Choosing Big Data Sets
Explore potential data sets for your project's topic from the [data library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/data-library/). List your options below, organizing them by whether they represent the system you're studying (e.g., deciduous forests) or the disruption to it (e.g., wildfire). Then discuss your choices and indicate your final selections.

### Draft Potential Data Sets
  - **System Being Perturbed/Disrupted:**
    - [List all potential data sets here]
  - **Perturbator/Disrupter:**
    - [List all potential data sets here]

### Final Choice
  - **System Being Perturbed/Disrupted (Final Choice):**
    - [Indicate your final selected data set here]
  - **Perturbator/Disrupter (Final Choice):**
    - [Indicate your final selected data set here]



## Brief Check-in: Definition of Resilience (approx. 5 mins)
Below is a working definition of the word "Resilience" for the Summit. Please edit the definition below based on your earlier discussion and chosen project.

*"Resilience is the capacity of a system, community, organization, or individual to absorb stress, recover from disruptions, adapt to change, and continue to develop and thrive."*
