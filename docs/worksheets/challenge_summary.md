# Challenge: Data Dirt and Data Draughts in the Prediction of Flash Floods


## Description
Flash flood forecasting is uniquely challenging due to the convergence of meteorlogical and hyperlocal hydrological conditions that influence flash flood outcomes. There is a need to better predict the risk of flash floods in order to issue flash flood warnings with more advanced notice. 

A barrier to improving flash flood forecasting is that data is too sparse in many regions to be able to accurately predict flash flood risk in a timely manner.

Datasets: 
* observed precipitation data
* augmented with radar data

However, these data often have severe limitations (e.g. areas with poor radar data and no observations are most prone to flash flooding). 


## Specific Objectives
1. Identify specific areas to add (NOAA) sensors (filling data gaps)
2. Select subset of data that improves prediction performance (mitigata bias / noisy data) 


## Evaluation
A committee will score each submission considering the three aspects listed below:

1. ??

2. Accuracy assessment: how much does model improve?

3. Novelty and practicality of the proposed procedure.

Participants are required to submit:
* The developed code
* A CSV file with **
* A report explaining the solution
