# Data Dirt and Data Draughts
## Connecting Communities to Cultivate the Environmental Data Ecosystem

### Research Question
#### Starting Question

> What gaps/biases are present in environmental data sets that are critical for assessing adaptation and resilence, and how can we address them?

#### Refined Question

> How can we bring together domain expertise (environmental science) with technical expertise (data science and machine learning) to identify and remedy data biases and data gaps in the environmental data ecosystem?

### Our Three-Pronged Approach

1. Data-centric machine-learning challenges  
   Inspirations: e.g., [DataPerf](https://www.dataperf.org/home) by [MLCommon's DMLR Group](https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/research/dmlr/) and [ITU AI for Good Challenge](https://aiforgood.itu.int/about-ai-for-good/aiml-solutions-for-climate-change/)
2. Data cards to document environmental datasets  
   Inspiration: Google's [Data Cards Playbook](https://sites.research.google/datacardsplaybook/)
5. Domain experts (researchers and decision-makers)

### Guiding Example: Flash-Flood Prediction

#### Description
Flash flood forecasting is uniquely challenging due to the convergence of meteorological and hyperlocal hydrological conditions that influence flash flood outcomes.  
There is a need to better predict the risk of flash floods in order to issue flash-flood warnings with more advanced notice.  
A barrier to improving flash-flood forecasting is that data is too sparse in many regions to be able to accurately predict flash-flood risk in a timely manner.

#### Illustration: Flash-Flood Data Draught

`Flash-Flood Observations vs. Flash-Flood Risk, based on FEMA Riverine Flooding Data`

#### Illustration: Flash-Flood Data Dirt

TODO Figure

`Flash-Flood Observations over Time`

#### Challenge Datasets

* Observed precipitation data
* Radar data

However, these data often have severe limitations (e.g., areas with poor radar data and no observations are most prone to flash flooding). 

#### Specific Objectives
1. Mitigating data draughts: Identify specific areas to add NOAA sensors
2. Mitigating data dirt: Select subset of data used to train models that improves the performance of flash-flood-prediction models

#### Evaluation
Each submission will be scored considering the three aspects listed below:

1. Performance improvement
How much does the model improve with regard to performance?

2. Holistic evaluation
How much does the model improve with regard to other evaluation criteria, such as fairness, data efficiency, parameter efficiency, and energy efficiency?

3. Practicality and novelty of the proposed procedure

Participants are required to submit:
* The developed code
* A challenge-dependent output deliverable
* A written report explaining the solution

### Day 2 Report Back

- What worked well for your team?
  - Free-floating brainstorming in the divergent-thinking phase
  - Turn-taking to work toward convergence
  - Splitting up tasks based on expertise and necessities
- What’s one thing you would change?
  - More streamlined data sharing and data access
- Did your group ever have an “ah-ha” moment? What led up to that moment?
  - Yes; in the lead-up to that, one technical person pitched the idea of designing challenges to engage with ML people, and one person with domain expertise jumped onto that with lots of ideas about challenges related to flash floods
  - After that, we had the basic structure for our three-pronged engagement approach
- Did your group experience the groan zone? What is one tip you want to share with future groups at the Summit about getting through the groan zone?
  - We probably experienced the groan zone yesterday already (goal wasn't clear; discussion turning in circles)
  - The check-in round in the morning established a good working climate to iterate through phases of divergent and convergent thinking
